       2. You can load a template in many ways. For convenience, we'll include it in
       a script tag so that we don't need to mess around with AJAX or multiline strings.
       Note that we've set the type attribute to 'text/ractive' - though it can be
       just about anything except 'text/javascript'
  -->
  <script id='template' type='text/ractive'>
    <p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>
  </script>

       loaded the library - now it's time to build our Hello World app.

      // The `el` option can be a node, an ID, or a CSS selector.
      el: 'container',

      // we're passing the ID of the <script> tag above.
